# VapourTrail

VapourTrail is an interactive bus map made from OpenStreetMap data.

![demo](demo.gif)

VapourTrail aims to be a large scale or local solution for visualizing bus lines based on OpenStreetMap data composed of:
* an interactive map with a schematic bus route display
* an API for bus routes
* a tileset of vector tiles

## Schema

:construction::warning: This is a work in progress, the schema is not stable yet :warning::construction:

## Contribute

### Dependencies

* imposm3
* postgre / postgis
* t-rex
* docker / docker-compose
* python3 with flask and SQLAlchemy

### How to run

Put an .osm.pbf file into `imposm/import/` directory.

Run `make run` to run the services (web, api, tiles and database) in detached mode.
Run `make data-update` to import or update the data to the Postgres database.

The tiles rendered by t-rex are available at `http://localhost:6767/`.

The web front-end is available at `http://localhost:8082/vapour_trail.html`.

The API (used by the front-end) is available at `http://localhost:5000`. The endpoint used is `/route/<string:route_id>`.

**Troubleshooting**:

If you have performance issues, you may want to pre-generate the tiles before using the front : `make generate-tiles bbox=minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat`

### Deploy a static version

To get a static version (that can work without t-rex and postgres):

* import data: `make docker-importer`
* generate tiles for your area of interest: `make generate-tiles bbox=minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat`
* prepare static publication: `make prepare-static static_url=http://localhost/tile`
* you can now deploy and serve the `static` folder

### Style Edition

The displayed map used bus vector tiles served by the t-rex server and [Jawg vector tiles](https://jawg.io) with a custom theme for the background style.

While the t-rex tiles server is running you can upload `glstyle.json` to the online [Maputnik Editor](http://editor.openmaptiles.org), make your changes and export it back to the project.
