# VapourTrail
VapourTrail is a vector tile schema for OpenStreetMap bus data.

It allows to create interactive map with buses without using Overpass API (because Overpass is great but we need to learn to stop relying on it).

## Use cases

Show bus stops

Show roads where buses go

Show properties of a bus stop (shelter, etc)

Show bus routes serving a bus stop

Show all tracks and stops for a selected bus route

Show properties and list of stops for a selected bus route

Show all routes for a bus line
