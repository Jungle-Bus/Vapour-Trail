# VapourTrail
VapourTrail is a vector tile schema for OpenStreetMap bus data.

It allows to create interactive map with buses without using Overpass API (because Overpass is great but we need to learn to stop relying on it).

![demo](img/demo.gif)

## Use cases

Show bus stops

Show roads where buses go

Show properties of a bus stop (shelter, etc)

Show bus routes serving a bus stop

Show all tracks and stops for a selected bus route

Show properties and list of stops for a selected bus route

Show all routes for a bus line

## Contribute
### Dependencies
* imposm3
* t-rex
* docker / docker-compose

### How to run
Run `docker-compose up -d` to run the services in detached mode.

The first run will perform several actions :

* download all the required base images,
* build and run the containers
* create the database
* import the osm.pbf file in the `docker/imposm/import/` directory
* execute the post_process SQL file

The tiles rendered by t-rex are available at `http://localhost:6767/`.

The web front-end is available at `http://localhost:82/vapour_trail.html`.

**Troubleshooting** : If you don't see the name of the bus stops on the map or if the bus stop popups are empty, try to restart t-rex service: `docker-compose restart t-rex`
