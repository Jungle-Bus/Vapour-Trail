### Dependencies

* imposm3
* t-rex
* docker / docker-compose

### How to run

Put an .osm.pbf file into docker/imposm/import directory.

Run `make docker-importer` to import the data to the Postgres database.

The first run will perform several actions:

* download all the required base images,
* build and run the containers
* create the database
* import the osm.pbf file in the `docker/imposm/import/` directory
* execute the post_process SQL file

Run `make up-d` to run the services in detached mode.

The tiles rendered by t-rex are available at `http://localhost:6767/`.

The web front-end is available at `http://localhost:8082/vapour_trail.html`.

**Troubleshooting**: If you don't see the name of the bus stops on the map after import or if the bus stop popups are empty, try to restart t-rex service: `docker-compose restart t-rex`

### Style Edition

The background style is in `web/glstyle.json` while the foreground style is in `web/vapour-style.json`. Both can be edited manually or with style editor.

With the t-rex tiles server running locally you can upload `vapour-style.json` to the online [Maputnik Editor](http://editor.openmaptiles.org) and exported back.

### Server less static version

After importing data, adjust the `Makefile` header variables and then run `make dump-tiles`. Tiles set will be present in `web/tiles`.
