VapourTrail is an interactive bus map made from OpenStreetMap data.

![demo](demo.gif)

VapourTrail aims to be a large scale or local solution for visualizing bus lines from OpenStreetMap data.

Vapour Trail is made of:
* a tileset of map vector tiles
* an API to query bus routes and stops
* a web front-end that turns the tiles and API into an interactive map

## How to run

You will need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

* Grab some OSM data (in `.osm.pbf` format) and put the file into the `imposm/import/` directory
* Start the services with `make run`
* Import or update the OSM data with `make update-data`

You can then browse your interactive map at `http://localhost:8082/`

**Troubleshooting**:

If you have performance issues, you may want to pre-generate the tiles before using the front-end : `make generate-tiles bbox=minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat`

## Deploy a static version

If you are on a small area or network, you can create and use a static version (that can work without its database, tile server and API):

* start the services with `make run`
* import data: `make update-data`
* generate tiles for your area of interest: `make generate-tiles bbox=minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat`
* prepare static publication: `make prepare-static static_url=http://localhost/`
* you can now deploy and serve the `static` folder

## Contribute

Behind the scenes, Vapour Trail uses
* [postgre](https://www.postgresql.org/) / [postgis](http://postgis.net/)
* [imposm3](https://imposm.org/)
* [t-rex](https://t-rex.tileserver.ch/)
* python3 with [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

The API is available at `http://localhost:5000`.

The tiles rendered by t-rex are available at `http://localhost:6767/`.

### Style Edition

The displayed map used bus vector tiles served by the t-rex server and [Jawg vector tiles](https://jawg.io) with a custom theme for the background style.

While the t-rex tiles server is running you can upload `glstyle.json` to the online [Maputnik Editor](http://editor.openmaptiles.org), make your changes and export it back to the project.
