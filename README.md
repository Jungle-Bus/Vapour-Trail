# VapourTrail

VapourTrail is an interactive bus map made from OpenStreetMap data.

![demo](demo.gif)

VapourTrail aims to be a large scale or local solution for visualizing bus lines from OpenStreetMap data.
Vapour Trail is made of:
* a tileset of map vector tiles
* an API to query bus routes and stops
* a web front-end that turns the tiles and API into an interactive map

## How to run

You will need [docker]() and [docker-compose]().

* Grab some OSM data (in `.osm.pbf` format) and put the file into the `imposm/import/` directory
* Start the services with `make run`
* Import or update the OSM data with `make data-update`

You can then browse your interactive map at `http://localhost:8082/`

**Troubleshooting**:

If you have performance issues, you may want to pre-generate the tiles before using the front-end : `make generate-tiles bbox=minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat`

## Contribute

Behind the scenes, Vapour Trail uses
* postgre / postgis
* imposm3
* t-rex
* python3 with flask and SQLAlchemy

The API is available at `http://localhost:5000`.

The tiles rendered by t-rex are available at `http://localhost:6767/`.

### Deploy a static version

If you are only interested in the vector tiles, you can get a static version (that can work without t-rex and postgres):

* import data: `make data-update`
* generate tiles for your area of interest: `make generate-tiles bbox=minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat`
* prepare static publication: `make prepare-static static_url=http://localhost/tile`
* you can now deploy and serve the `static` folder

### Style Edition

The displayed map used bus vector tiles served by the t-rex server and [Jawg vector tiles](https://jawg.io) with a custom theme for the background style.

While the t-rex tiles server is running you can upload `glstyle.json` to the online [Maputnik Editor](http://editor.openmaptiles.org), make your changes and export it back to the project.
